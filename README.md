# Plant_Monitor
Plant Monitoring Embedded Systems

This was a 4 person group project which combined the Beaglebone + Zen Cape with different components to monitor plant health and automatically water when moisture dropped below a certain level. Components included: moisture sensor, light sensor, temperature sensor, and humidity sensor. A 14-segment display was used to display active status of each sensor. 

The project is accompanied by a website, which constantly reads data obtained from sensors and outputs a graph to the user using Python. Additionally, buttons are available on the website to manually activate the pump or change what the display is showing.
